# Sign-language-digit-classification

This model is used to predict the digits by using sign language. This model works best with hand images with clear white background.
Further development of the project in order to predict with any background and a live web based application is under progress.
In order to predict now you need to provide the path of the image.

#### Model files -Containing essentials functions to train model and save model and its weights.
#### Main.py - Used to train model
#### predict.py - Used to predict the sign by providing the image path.

### Dataset used:

But this dataset has some mismatching, hence the correct data is given as a .tar file in the repository.
